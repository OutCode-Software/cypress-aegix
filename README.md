# Cypress E2E Testing
Introduction

This README provides a comprehensive guide to setting up and running end-to-end (E2E) tests using Cypress. Cypress is a JavaScript-based end-to-end testing framework that is easy to set up, powerful, and user-friendly. This document will walk you through the process of setting up Cypress, writing tests, and running them.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

Node.js (version 12 or higher)
npm (Node Package Manager) or Yarn

Setup
1. Yarn install or npm run install
2. npx cypress open


Folder Structure

After opening Cypress for the first time, you'll notice a new folder cypress created with the following structure:

cypress/fixtures: Test data that can be used in your tests.
cypress/integration: Where your test files (specs) will go.
cypress/plugins: Plugins for extending Cypress functionality.
cypress/support: Commands and configurations that are globally available to your tests.
